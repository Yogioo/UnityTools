Hi :)

Here is a small modular kit! Free for commercial or freeware games/apps.
The package is given for free, do not contact me for modifications or special works...

You can use the package for freeware and shareware applications, games, videos.
But you can't re-sale the meshes/datas/textures on another store (like Unreal or Second Life market)
